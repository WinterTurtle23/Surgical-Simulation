## 🎯 Project Overview
**Surgical Simulation - CPR** is a **VR medical training simulation** designed to teach and assess **CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) techniques** and emergency response skills. Utilizing **hand-tracking technology**, this immersive experience enables users to practice **life-saving procedures** in a realistic virtual environment.

## 🛠️ Features
- **🖐️ Hand Tracking** – Perform CPR without controllers using natural hand movements.
- **🩺 Realistic Medical Procedures** – Follow step-by-step **CPR & AED (Automated External Defibrillator) usage**.
- **🩸 Dynamic Patient Response** – The patient's condition reacts based on your actions.
- **🏥 Medical Training Scenarios** – Train for real-world emergency situations.
- **🎓 Interactive Learning** – Receive guided feedback and assessment.
- **🛠️ Optimized for VR** – Compatible with **Meta Quest and PCVR**.
